Gazebo Harbour Models

These models were created as a part of [Cargo-ANTS] project which required a simulation environment of a container terminal scenario.
So many harbour entities were created using freely available Google sketchup models like ship, idle_truck, containers, straddle_carriers, etc. Note: These models are simple sdf models and not URDF models and do not have dynamic engine.
Feel free to use these models and please cite the following paper:
